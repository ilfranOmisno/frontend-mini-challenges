In this article, we will share some tips on how to protect your Facebook Messenger account from hackers and what to do if you think your account has been hacked or taken over by someone else.
 
## How to Secure Your Facebook Messenger Account
 
The first step to protect your Facebook Messenger account from hackers is to make sure you have a strong and unique password that you don't use for any other online accounts. You can change your password from the Settings menu on the Facebook app or website.
 
You should also enable two-factor authentication, which adds an extra layer of security to your account by requiring a code or a confirmation from another device when you log in from a new location or device. You can turn on two-factor authentication from the Security and Login section of the Settings menu.
 
Another way to secure your Facebook Messenger account is to review your active sessions and log out of any devices that you don't recognize or use anymore. You can see your active sessions from the Security and Login section of the Settings menu and tap on See More to view all the devices where you're logged in. You can tap on Log Out to end any session that looks suspicious or unfamiliar.

Facebook will review your report and take appropriate action against the fake account.
 
## Conclusion
 
Facebook Messenger is a great way to stay in touch with your friends and family, but it also comes with some risks of being hacked or impersonated by malicious actors. By following the tips above, you can protect your account from hackers and report any fake accounts that try to scam you or harm your reputation.
  
## How to Avoid Facebook Messenger Scams
 
Not all messages you receive on Facebook Messenger are genuine. Some of them may be scams that try to trick you into handing over money or personal data. Here are some tips on how to avoid Facebook Messenger scams and spot the warning signs:
 
- Never trust any financial offers that come through Facebook Messenger. Scammers may claim that you have won a lottery, a grant, or a loan, and ask you to pay a small fee or provide your bank details to receive it. These are all fake and you should never respond to them.
- Ask questions to verify your friend's identity if they send you anything surprising. Call them outside of Messenger, on your cell phone, and see what they say about the messages. Scammers may hack into your friend's account or create a fake one that looks like them and send you messages pretending to be them.
- Beware of shared computers, hotspots, or public WiFi. These may not be secure and hackers may be able to access your account or intercept your messages. Always use a strong password and log out of your account when you're done.
- Encrypt your information online. Use a VPN (virtual private network) service to protect your online activity from prying eyes. A VPN creates a secure connection between your device and the internet, making it harder for hackers to spy on you or steal your data.
- Report any suspicious messages or accounts to Facebook. If you see something you think is a scam, you should avoid responding and report the scam to Facebook. You can do this by tapping on the profile picture of the sender and selecting Report. You can also visit this page[^1^] for more help on how to recover your account if you think it has been hacked or taken over.

## Conclusion
 
Facebook Messenger is a convenient way to communicate with your friends and family, but it also exposes you to potential scams and frauds. By following the tips above, you can protect yourself from Facebook Messenger scams and enjoy a safer online experience.
